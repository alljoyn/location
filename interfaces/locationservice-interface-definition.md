### Structures
#### entity

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| field Name            | entityId      | string | The assigned identifier for the entity       |
| field Name            | entityMac     | string | The physical address of the entity (MAC)     |

Entities are objects that are tracked by the location services. An entity may or may not be a member of the AllJoyn bus. An entity may be known or anonymous. A known entity is registered with the service by an application. Entities that are discovered, and not pre-registered are designated as unknown entities.
An entity is comprised of two strings, a unique identifier and a media specific identifier. The media specific identifier will normally be the MAC address. Location Services uses both the unique identifier and the media specific identifier when matching entities. Anonymous entities will have a unique identifier of B5872451-E0C2-473F-B7C7-BB96D5A749A0 and a media specific identifier of their MAC address. 

#### defaultPrivacyPolicy
|---------------|-------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Field Name    | presencePolicy    | int32 | enum of ALLOW, DISALLOW or CALLBACK               |
| Field Name    | proximityPolicy   | int32 | enum of ALLOW, DISALLOW or CALLBACK               |
| Field Name    | locationPolicy    | int32 | enum of ALLOW, DISALLOW or CALLBACK               |
| Field Name    | containmentPolicy | int32 | enum of ALLOW, DISALLOW or CALLBACK               |

Location Services uses privacy policies to protect the privacy of entities. The policy controls the disbursement of presence, proximity, location or containment information. Each entity has a default policy, a white list and a black list for each of the four services. The default policy can be ALLOW, DISALLOW or CALLBACK. In the case of a CALLBACK, a callback is made to the creator of the entity to determine if the entities information can be disbursed. The white list and black list contain application names. Queries and subscriptions from applications on the entities white list will always be fulfilled; queries and subscriptions from applications on the entities black list will be fail. Queries and subscriptions from applications not on either list will follow the entities default policy. If policy has not been applied to an entity, the default policy will be ALLOW. Privacy policies can also be applied to groups, the only difference is that the default policy for a group cannot be CALLBACK. If there is a disparity between a groupâ€™s policy and the policy of an entity, the entities policy takes precedence.
Note that CALLBACK does cannot be applied to privacy policy on an entity group.

### Interface Errors



The method calls in this interface use the AllJoyn error message handling feature
(`ER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE`) to set the error name and error message. The table
below lists the possible errors raised by this interface.

| Error name                                            | Error message                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| org.alljoyn.locationservices.Error.EntityDoesNotExist | The entity was not found in the service   |
| org.alljoyn.locationservices.Error.GroupDoesNotExist  | The group was not found in the service    |
| org.alljoyn.locationservices.Error.GroupExists        | The group already exists                  |
